/*
  Code by:
  M.Hashir and Wardah Arshad

  This is a code that generates different tunes using buzzer at pin 11

To do:
Also download pitches.h from this repository and put it in the same folder with this code.

  Hardware:
  -Arduino
  -buzzer

  Connections:
  -Connect longer leg of buzzer to pin 11 of Arduino
  -Connect shorter leg of buzzer to GND of Arduino
*/
